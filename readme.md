## üì¶ Using GNU Stow

To keep things tidy, I've structured the repo so you can manage your dotfiles with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). If you don't know what GNU Stow is, it's basically an easy way to symlink your configs into `~/.config/` effortlessly!


To download GNU Stow:
```bash
sudo pacman -S stow
```

## üì• Cloning the Repo

It is **very important** to clone this repository directly into your **home directory** to ensure all the stow commands given below work correctly.

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Cards29/arch-hyprland-config.git
cd ""
```

## üöÄ Stow Commands

Once you‚Äôve cloned this repo, cd into it and run Stow for the components you want:

```bash
# In your dotfiles root directory:

# Hyprland config
stow hyprland

# Waybar config
stow waybar

# Kitty terminal config
stow kitty
```

For **Rofi**, please follow the  [adi1090x/rofi](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi) repository for themes and additional setup!

## üåÑ Changing Wallpapers with Swww

Use the `swww_random_wallpaper.sh` script in the **Scripts/** folder. Add it to your Hyprland key bindings to cycle wallpapers on the fly:

```ini
# Example in your Hyprland keybinds (e.g., hyprland.conf)
bind = SUPER, w, exec, $HOME/dotfiles/Scripts/swww_random_wallpaper.sh
```

Now you can hit **Super + W** to refresh your background instantly!
